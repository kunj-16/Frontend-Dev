Question 1 : Explain the difference between frontend, backend, and full-stack development with
suitable real-world examples.
Answer : 
--Frontend: It's about what users see and interacts with or we can say it is the client-side of the 
application. The goal is to create a accessible and enjoyable user experience(UX) and user interface
(UI).
    >Technologies used:
    HTML(for atructure)
    CSS(for styling)
    JavaScript(for interaction)

    >Example: It is like the dining area of the restaurant. It's the part the customer experiences: the 
    decration, the tables, menu and the waiter who takes order. It's all about presentation and user 
    interaction.

--Backend: The engine that powers the frontend, but the user never sees it. It is the server-side of 
the application. It is responsible for managing data, logic and communicaion between the database and the
browser. 
    >Technologies used: Python, java, Node.js 

    >Example: In a restaurant the backend is a kitchen, where the food is cooked. Customer don't see the kitchen, 
    but it's where the actual work happens. The chefs(developers), ovens(servers), and the pantries(database) all 
    work together.

--Full Stack: It contains both frontend and backend. A full-stack developer is proficient in both the client-side 
and the server-side parts of an application and understands how they work together.
    >Technologies used: MongoDb, Express.js, react, node.js

    >Example: In a restaurant, a full-stack developer is a manager, who understands what's happening in the dining area
    (frontend) and knows how the kitchen operates(backends).


Question 2 : Create a simple diagram showing how the client-server model works in web architecture.


Question 3 : Describe how a browser requests and displays a web page from a web server.
Answer : We ask → Browser requests → Server sends → Browser shows.

1. Type a website address (URL) in the browser.
2. Browser asks the for the server’s IP address.
3. Browser sends a request to the web server at that IP asking for the page.
4. Server responds by sending back the web page’s files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).
5. Browser reads these files and builds the page you see on your screen.
6. Browser displays the page and runs any scripts for interactivity.


Question 4 : Identify and list the tools required to set up a web development environment. Explain the
purpose of each.
Answer : Text editor to write code, browser to view it, server to host it, version control to track changes, package
manager for libraries, and database to store data.


Question 5 : Explain what a web server is and give examples of commonly used servers.
Answer : A web server is a computer that stores website files and shows them to you when you visit a website.
    >Example: Apache, Nginx, Microsoft IIS


Question 6 : Define the roles of a frontend developer, backend developer, and database administrator
in a project.
Answer : The frontend developer is responsible for everything the user see and interact with, like the interior designer
and waiter of the restaurant.
The backend developer works behind the scenes. They build and maintain the server, application, and database.
The database administrator is incaharge of database, which is like the restaurant storeroom where all the ingredients(data) are kept.
DBAs job is to organize, manage and protect all data which includes user information, product details and order history.


Question 8 : Explain the difference between static and dynamic websites. Provide an example of
each.
Answer : 
--Static Website: In this the pages are pre-built ans stored on a server. The content is fixed and doesn't change unless
the website's code is updated manually.
They don't use a database. They are generally very fast secure because of their simplicity.
>Example: Personal portfolio website showcases a designer's work contains the info - bio, projects and contact details.

--Dynamic Website: In this the pages are generated in rel-time based on various factors, such as the user, the time, 
user location. The content can change and be personalized for each user. They can be a bit slower than static sites
because the server has to do more work to generate the page.
>Example: Social media platforms like facebook, Instagram. Feed is unique to person-to-person and constantly updated
          with posts from the person's followers and following.


Question 9 : Research and list five web browsers. Explain how rendering engines differ between
them.
Answer : Five we browsers are as following:
1. Google chrome
2. Microsoft edge
3. Brave
4. Mozilla FIrefox
5. Apple Safari

--Rendering Engine is the brain for interpreting code, i.e.  it's job is to read the code(like, HTML, CSS and js) and translate
  it into the visual webpage we see on our screen.

Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Brave are all built on the same open-source foundation called CHROMIUM
and they use rendering engines called Blink. It's like the three different car brands using the exact same
engine and perform very similarly.

Mozilla firefox uses it's own rendering engine called GECKO. While blink and gecko follow the same web standards,
but built independently. You can say a website might look slightly different or have a minor glitch.

Apple safari uses WebKit. 


Question 10 : Draw a labeled diagram showing the basic web architecture flow — client, server,
database, and APIs.
