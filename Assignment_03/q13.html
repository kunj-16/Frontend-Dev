        Welcome to my photography journey! I have always believed that every picture has a story to tell.
        Through my lens, I aim to capture the beauty hidden in everyday life — from sunrises to street scenes.
        This blog will be my space to share those moments and the lessons I learn along the way.

      <h2>Things I Learned This Week</h2>
      <p><time datetime="2025-10-08">October 8, 2025</time></p>
      <p>
        This week taught me the power of lighting in photography. Natural light can completely transform a picture,
        especially during golden hour. I also experimented with manual mode — adjusting ISO, shutter speed,
        and aperture helped me understand how these settings shape the mood of a photograph.
