    <p>
      The <mark>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</mark> (RSS) is a volunteer organization founded in 1925 in Nagpur, India, by <mark>Keshav Baliram Hedgewar</mark>. It aims to promote the idea of national unity, discipline, and cultural pride among Indian citizens. The RSS believes in the philosophy of selfless service, social reform, and character building as the foundation for a strong and self-reliant nation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The organization’s structure is based on local units called “shakhas,” where members gather regularly for physical training, moral education, and discussions on social and national issues. These gatherings encourage teamwork, leadership, and devotion toward the motherland. Over the years, the RSS has inspired many social, educational, and service-based organizations across India.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ideology of RSS emphasizes the concept of <mark>Hindutva</mark>, which represents cultural nationalism rather than religious identity. It encourages people to respect all faiths while maintaining a deep connection with India’s ancient traditions and values. The movement focuses on strengthening society from the grassroots level through awareness, education, and service.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "The strength of a nation lies not merely in its economy or defense but in the moral and cultural values of its people."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Throughout its history, the RSS has played a role during major national events such as relief work during natural calamities and community development in rural areas. Its volunteers have often been seen helping during floods, earthquakes, and other emergencies, promoting the spirit of humanity and unity above all differences.
    </p>

    <p>
      The organization has also been involved in establishing institutions related to education, rural development, and social welfare. Through these initiatives, the RSS strives to create a society where people live with discipline, respect, and responsibility toward one another and the nation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In modern India, the <mark>Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</mark> continues to influence public life through its vision of building a strong, united, and self-confident nation rooted in cultural heritage and social harmony. Its motto — “Service before self” — remains central to its mission even a century after its founding.
